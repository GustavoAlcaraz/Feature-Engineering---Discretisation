 Discretisation plus Encoding

What shall we do with the variable after discretisation? should we use the buckets as a numerical 
variable? or should we use the intervals as categorical variable?

The answer is, you can do either.

If you are building decision tree based algorithms and the output of the discretisation are integers 
(each integer referring to a bin), then you can use those directly, as decision trees will pick 
up non-linear relationships between the discretised variable and the target.

If you are building linear models instead, the bins may not necessarily hold a linear 
relationship with the target. In this case, it may help improve model performance to 
treat the bins as categories and to one hot encoding, or target guided encodings like 
mean encoding, weight of evidence, or target guided ordinal encoding.

We can easily do so by combining feature-engine's discretisers and encoders.

 In this demo

We will perform equal frequency discretisation followed by target guided orginal encoding.

If instead you would like to do weight of evidence or mean target encoding, you need only 
replace the Feature-engine's encoder.
